    <h2 class="subheading">Description</h2>
    Another lovely way to use up summer produce is with a dish as beautiful as it is delicious. Editor Bridget Olson loves making this ratatouille with her kids. Not only is it a showstopper to put on the dining table, but it's also packed with fresh flavor in the layers of eggplant, squash, bell peppers, and tangy tomato. The hundreds of five-star reviews agree it's worth the time and effort.
